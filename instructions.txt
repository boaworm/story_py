KEY EVENTS:

Out on the ocean, Calder decides to head south. With the boat filled with fresh fruit and cold mountain water, they had plenty of provisions. 
But they also remembered the cave, and the dangerous creater that must live there.
As they kept sailing, they saw two ships on the horizon, one following the other.
Kirsten, with her keen elvish eyes, said the first ship was a fishing boat. And the other was a pirate ship. The Corsairs of Umbar, terrifying bandits of the sea.
The group decides to help the fishermen. Their elvish ship is much faster, and just as the Corsairs catch up with the fishermen, they cought up with the two ships.
They jumped aboard the Corsairs ship and fought a hard battle, defeating the pirates and rescuing the fishermen.
After the battle, they bandaged up the wounded fishermen, and stayed with them for a day on the open seas, helping them mend their sails.
One of the fishermen asked where they got all their fruit.
Calder tells them about the island.
The fishermen look terrified, explaining that EÃ¤rcaraxe lives there. A huge, green water-dragon. big enough to crush ships. 
They bid farewell to the fishermen, and continue their journey.
